# Guideline for Issues

- If you have any question about GitBucket, send it to [gitter room](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket) before raise an issue.
- Make sure check whether there is a same question or request in the past.
- When raise a new issue, write subject in **English** at least.
- We can also support in Japaneses other than English at [gitter room for Japanese](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket_ja).
- First priority of GitBucket is easy installation and reproduce GitHub behavior, so we might reject if your request is against it.
